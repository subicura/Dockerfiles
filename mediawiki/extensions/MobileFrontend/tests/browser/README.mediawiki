= Setup =
Unfortunately there are various tweaks you will need to make to any
instance you run these tests against See
[https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56057 bug 56057].

These include:
* GeoData extension must be installed for the purpose of the nearby tests
* Ensure you have [//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmEdit Extension:ConfirmEdit] installed
** and setup with FancyCaptcha
* Create an account Selenium_newuser which has an edit count of 0
* Create an account and store the username in MEDIAWIKI_USER which has
** an edit count of greater than 0
** Ensure user has bureaucrat and admin rights (set via Special:UserRights)
* Setup a Spanish Interwiki link using sql:
<pre>
INSERT INTO interwiki (iw_prefix, iw_url, iw_local, iw_trans) VALUES ("es", "http://wikifoo.org/es/index.php/$1", 0, 0);
</pre>
* In LocalSettings.php place the following code:
<pre>
  $wgMFNearbyEndpoint = 'https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/api.php'; // required for nearby.feature
  $wgSiteName = 'Wikipedia'; // required for purpose of login_required_uploads.feature
</pre>
* Make sure that $wgRightsPage is not set in LocalSettings.php

Note a few caveats with browser tests:
* Random page tests may fail on a timeout
* Nearby page may fail currently if your browser does not always allow geolocation tests
	** Nearby tests currently check articles near your current location and assume there is
	an article nearby.

= MobileFrontend Extension =

For general information about MobileFrontend Extension please see
README.mediawiki file in the root of the repository.

==== Selenium tests ====

To run the Selenium tests you will have to install Ruby (for the exact
version see Gemfile), the latest versions of RubyGems and Firefox.

The easiest way to install Ruby on *nix is RVM (https://rvm.io/) and on
Windows RubyInstaller (http://rubyinstaller.org/).

Open terminal in tests/browser. Update RubyGems and install required
gems with:

  gem update --system
  gem install bundler
  bundle install

Environment variables MEDIAWIKI_USER and MEDIAWIKI_PASSWORD are required for
tests tagged `@login`. For local testing, create a test user on your local wiki
and export the user and password as the values for those variables.
For example:

  export MEDIAWIKI_USER=<username here> # Linux/Unix/Mac
  set MEDIAWIKI_USER=<username here> # Windows

  export MEDIAWIKI_PASSWORD=<password here> # Linux/Unix/Mac
  set MEDIAWIKI_PASSWORD=<password here> # Windows

In addition to this create another user which will be reserved for new uploads
"Selenium_newuser". The password for this user should be the same as
MEDIAWIKI_PASSWORD

Tests that use the "Given I create a random page using the API" step need to set
the MEDIAWIKI_API_URL environment variable, e.g.
export MEDIAWIKI_API_URL=http://en.wikipedia.beta.wmflabs.org/w/api.php

Run the tests from the MobileFrontend directory with:

  make cucumber

If you want to run a single set of tests, go to the tests/browser directory and
call 'bundle exec cucumber' with the path to the test file. For example, to run
only the watchlist tests:

  bundle exec cucumber features/watchstar.feature

XML report (for Jenkins) is created at tests/browser/reports/junit.

Jenkins is hosted at https://wmf.ci.cloudbees.com/ and it drives
browsers at http://saucelabs.com/
