Morning Light
=========
Quite a while ago, I found this great jPlayer skin on GitHub. It was nice, simple, and great looking! But what I soon found out was that it was only for jPlayer 2.0.0. That got me thinking, "Hey! Why don't I update it?!". And I did just that!

It actually ended up looking pretty good :D

Compatibility
=========
Morning Light will support any jPlayer version from 2.1.0 all the way to the current developmental build. I recommend you keep up to date on your jPlayer installation. Morning Light also uses some CSS3 features such as *border-radius*, *text-shadow*, and *box-shadow* (specifically *box-shdaow: inset*) so it won't show up in IE8 or lower. If you want, you can use [CSS3PIE](http://css3pie.com/) to enable *border-radius* in IE8 and lower but *text-shadow* and *box-shadow: inset* are still a WIP. I'll add support for CSS3PIE as soon as they add more functionality to it.

This skin was originally created by [persand](https://github.com/persand). He made it for jPlayer 2.0.0 and I simply updated the CSS and added a few more images. I only take 40% credit for this work.

The orginal theme for jPlayer 2.0.0 can be found here - https://github.com/persand/jPlayer-skins
